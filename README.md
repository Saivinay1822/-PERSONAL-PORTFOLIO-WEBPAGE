The task is to design and develop a basic single-page portfolio website using HTML and CSS to showcase a developer's personal projects, skills, and contact information. The primary objective is to create a responsive and visually appealing webpage that works seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The website must include a fixed navigation bar at the top that enables smooth scrolling to different sections of the page, namely: Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
The Home section should include a brief introduction with the developerâ€™s name and role. The About section must summarize the developer's skills and experience. The Projects section will highlight at least three sample projects, each with a title and short description. The Contact section should include basic contact details like email and GitHub profile.
The design should follow modern UI/UX principles with a clean layout, readable fonts, and attractive color schemes. CSS must be used to create a consistent visual style, including spacing, typography, and responsive grid layouts. No JavaScript is required for this basic version, although it can be added for enhanced interactivity later. The final deliverable is a functional and aesthetically pleasing single-page developer portfolio.
